Even though his last 600m (~36.0s) was moderate when outsprinted in the Coongy, his overall figures and proven 2040m strength make him the standout statistically."

Drawn barrier 1, she should secure a ground-saving run and at 56kg (SWP conditions) her figures make her one of the statistically strongest contenders."

          "top_pick": "Klabel",
          "confidence": 4,
          "reason": "His rating of 91 is respectable in this Group 2 sprint field. Drawn the inside barrier, he can utilize his early pace to advantage. While his last 600m (35.5s) was only even, he is a genuine on-speed runner carrying 58.5kg at WFA, and his consistency makes him a value statistical chance to run a bold race."

No issues with the 2040m trip and he unleashed an approximate 33.5s final 600m last start. With 57kg at set weights, his statistics (rating and sectionals) make him the one to beat."

          "reason": "The highest internationally rated horse in the field with a figure of 127, well above her Cox Plate rivals. She won the G1 Winx Stakes first-up and has been consistently near her top form. From barrier 5 she maps well and her steady 34.5s last 600m at 2000m last run confirms she remains on target. At 57kg (mare WFA), her class edge is clear on the numbers."

From barrier 2 she should secure a better run, and although she carries 59.5kg, her rating and sectional speed give her a clear statistical advantage."

Nicely drawn in barrier 5 and carrying 58.5kg in a 2000m Benchmark 70, his form and times make him statistically one of the top contenders."

Trialled well leading into this, indicating a fast closing 600m around 34.0s when at peak. The negatives are a wide barrier (20) and top weight 60kg, but on pure numbers he has the ability to outrun his odds if things go right."

A big rise in class and a wide gate (20) temper confidence, but she carries the minimum 54kg, and her late speed figure suggests she can surprise if the pace is on."

His recent win featured a solid 35.6s last 600m and given the huge weight pull and strong form, he holds a significant objective edge."
